When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    
Two main uses:
* Collaborate with others (or show your work to others)
* Back up

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    
* Because some commits you make might not be ready for sharing yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    
FORKS: it's a clone just on github. It's useful if you want to modify the repository of somebody else (without his original being impacted)
CLONES: it copies a git repository elsewhere (locally). That copy then takes a life of its own. It's useful to work on code locally.
BRANCHES: it's a part of a git repository. It's useful if you want to try other parts of the code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    
It allows you to run diff comparisons on it, even if you're offline.

and what would be harder?
